# DiceRollingSimulator

This is a classic "roll the dice" program. 

We will be using the random module for this,since we want to randomize the numbers we get from the dice. 

We use a list where it has numbers from 1-6,so as the number of sides of a dice. 

We then use a while loop, so that the user can roll the dice again. 

Initially we set the value a=1,so it enters to the while loop and rolls the dice.So in order to roll the dice again,The user can enter the value.

If the user eneters 1 so the dice rolls again,if enters 2 then it exists from the loop.
